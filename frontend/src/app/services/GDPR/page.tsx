const gdprFAQs = [
    {
        question: "What exactly is a GDPR compliance audit?",
        answer:
            "A GDPR compliance audit examines how your organisation collects, stores, processes and shares personal data to determine whether you meet GDPR requirements. It includes technical checks, policy reviews, privacy process assessments and evidence collection to demonstrate compliance.",
    },
    {
        question: "Does GDPR apply to Indian companies?",
        answer:
            "Yes — GDPR applies to any organisation, regardless of location, that processes personal data of EU residents or offers goods/services to them (e.g. a website selling to EU customers or targeted advertising aimed at EU citizens).",
    },
    {
        question: "What penalties can organisations face for GDPR violations?",
        answer:
            "Supervisory authorities can impose fines up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide annual turnover (whichever is higher). Other measures include orders to stop processing and reputational damage from public enforcement actions.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does a GDPR audit take?",
        answer:
            "Smaller organisations can complete a basic audit in 2–4 weeks. Medium and large enterprises often take 4–12 weeks depending on complexity, third-party involvement and the pace of evidence collection.",
    },
    {
        question: "What documents and information will you need from us?",
        answer:
            "Typical inputs: privacy policies, data processing agreements, system inventories, prior incident logs, consent records, DPIAs (if available), data transfer agreements (SCCs/BCRs) and a list of third-party processors and sub-processors.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will you perform technical testing as part of the audit?",
        answer:
            "Yes — we perform technical validation (configuration reviews, access control checks, secure defaults) and can integrate full VAPT/penetration testing for systems in scope in partnership with our technical services team.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is RoPA and why is it important?",
        answer:
            "RoPA (Record of Processing Activities) documents what personal data you process, for what purpose, and who has access. It's a core GDPR requirement for many organisations and is often requested during regulatory reviews.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do we handle cross-border transfers?",
        answer:
            "Cross-border transfers require a lawful mechanism such as Adequacy, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). We assess your transfer mechanisms and recommend compliant options for your business model.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can GDPR work be combined with ISO 27001?",
        answer:
            "Absolutely. GDPR and ISO 27001 share many control objectives. Combining efforts reduces duplicated work — policy updates, risk assessments and security controls often serve both frameworks.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is GDPR compliance a one-time activity?",
        answer:
            "No — GDPR compliance is ongoing. Regular audits, continuous monitoring, vendor reviews and periodic updates to privacy notices and DPIAs are recommended as business processes and systems evolve.",
    },
