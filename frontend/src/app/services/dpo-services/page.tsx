        question: "What is an Outsourced DPO (Data Protection Officer)?",

            "An Outsourced DPO is an external, independent data protection expert who performs the statutory functions of a Data Protection Officer - monitoring compliance, advising on data protection obligations, handling data subject requests, and liaising with regulators - without being a full-time employee. ISECURION's Outsourced DPO services are available across India and globally across USA, UK, EU, GCC, Singapore, and Australia.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is a DPO mandatory under India's DPDP Act 2023?",
        answer:
            "Under India's Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023, entities classified as Significant Data Fiduciaries are required to appoint a Data Protection Officer based in India. Many other organisations voluntarily appoint a DPO or equivalent contact person to manage grievance redressal and demonstrate accountability, even where not strictly mandated.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do we need a DPO under GDPR?",
        answer:
            "Under GDPR Article 37, a DPO is mandatory for public authorities, organisations whose core activities involve large-scale, regular and systematic monitoring of individuals, or large-scale processing of special category data. Many organisations outside these categories still appoint a DPO voluntarily as a best practice and trust signal for customers.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between an Outsourced DPO and a vCISO?",
        answer:
            "A DPO focuses specifically on data protection and privacy compliance - lawful processing, consent, data subject rights, breach notification, and regulator liaison. A vCISO owns the broader information security function, including infrastructure, application, and cyber risk. Many organisations engage both; ISECURION can deliver DPO and vCISO services under one coordinated engagement.",
    },
    {
        question: "Which Indian cities does ISECURION serve for DPO services?",
        answer:

        question: "Can an Outsourced DPO handle Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs)?",
        answer:
            "Yes. ISECURION's DPO team manages the full DSAR lifecycle - intake, identity verification, response drafting, and timely closure - in line with DPDP Act and GDPR timelines, along with grievance redressal officer duties where required.",

        question: "Can the DPO act as the point of contact for regulators?",

            "Yes. ISECURION's Outsourced DPO can be formally designated as the organisation's point of contact for the Data Protection Board of India, supervisory authorities under GDPR, or equivalent regulators, and will manage regulator correspondence, audits, and breach notifications on your behalf.",

        question: "How quickly can ISECURION appoint an outsourced DPO?",

    {
        question: "Is outsourced DPO suitable for startups and SMEs?",
        answer:
            "Yes. Outsourced DPO is ideal for startups, SMEs, and mid-market companies that need qualified privacy leadership and a named point of contact for compliance without the cost of a full-time in-house hire.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can DPO services cover multiple countries at once?",
        answer:
