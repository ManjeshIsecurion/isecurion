const phishingFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What is a phishing simulation?",
    answer:
      "A controlled exercise that emulates phishing attacks to measure employee response, reporting behaviour and SOC readiness without exposing the organisation to real-world risk.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are these simulations safe and legally compliant?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We operate under a Rules of Engagement (ROE) agreed with stakeholders and legal counsel. Sensitive employees are excluded and evidence is handled securely.",
  },
  {
    question: "How frequently should we run simulations?",
    answer:
      "Continuous programs run monthly micro-campaigns with quarterly comprehensive reporting. Frequency can be adapted by risk cohort.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will employees be penalised for failing?",
    answer:
      "Our recommended approach is coaching and targeted training, not punitive measures. Organisations may define HR policies separately.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide remediation materials?",
    answer:
      "Yes, role-based micro-learning, quizzes, and LMS-integrated modules are supplied to remediate identified weaknesses.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you simulate credential-harvesting safely?",
    answer:
      "Credential capture is performed on isolated, encrypted endpoints with immediate containment and no storage of plaintext credentials.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are vishing and smishing included?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Voice and SMS channels are available to evaluate mobile risk and reporting behaviour.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you target specific departments or geographies?",
    answer:
      "Campaigns can be segmented by role, business unit or legal jurisdiction to align with policy constraints and risk focus.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are results shared?",
    answer:
      "Results are distributed via executive summaries, technical evidence packs and an interactive Drosera dashboard for authorised users.",
  },
  {
    question: "What KPIs do you track?",
    answer:
      "CTR, report rate, human risk score, repeat failures, mean time to detect for simulated incidents and remediation completion.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long is onboarding?",
    answer:
      "Onboarding typically takes 1 - 2 weeks for pilots and 2 - 4 weeks for larger rollouts depending on integrations and approvals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you integrate with SIEM/LMS/HR systems?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We offer connector-based exports and API integrations to forward events to SIEMs, assign training in LMS and map users in HR systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is employee privacy protected?",
    answer:
      "All personal data is protected under contractual safeguards, encrypted in transit and at rest, with retention policies agreed with clients.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this help with compliance?",
    answer:
      "Yes, deliverables include compliance mapping for ISO 27001, SOC 2 and privacy frameworks to support auditors and attestations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we start?",
    answer:
      "Contact ISECURION at info@isecurion.com or submit the enquiry form. We'll schedule a discovery call and provide an SOW and timeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a good phishing click-through rate benchmark?",
    answer:
      "Mature, security-aware organisations typically target a click-through rate below 5%, tracked through continuous monthly simulation programs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is phishing simulation different from a real phishing attack?",
    answer:
      "It uses the same lure techniques as real attackers but runs under an agreed Rules of Engagement, with no data exfiltration, safe credential capture, opt-out lists for sensitive staff, and immediate containment of any accidental exposure.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Drosera?",
    answer:
      "Drosera is ISECURION's proprietary AI phishing simulation and human risk management platform. It runs continuous, AI-generated phishing campaigns from high-reputation, whitelist-free sending infrastructure and calculates a human risk score from delivery, engagement and reporting behaviour. Learn more at drosera.ai.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does ISECURION use its own tool for phishing simulations?",
    answer:
      "Yes. ISECURION's phishing simulation engagements are powered by Drosera, our in-house AI platform, which is also used by red teams, offensive security teams and MSSPs to run and manage phishing campaigns at scale.",
