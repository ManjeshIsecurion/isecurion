const vcisoFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What is a vCISO (Virtual CISO)?",
    answer:
      "A vCISO (Virtual Chief Information Security Officer) is an outsourced security leader who provides high-level strategic and operational cybersecurity leadership to organisations without a full-time in-house CISO. ISECURION's vCISO services are available across India (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai) and globally across USA, Singapore, UAE, Australia, and Europe.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do Indian companies specifically need vCISO services?",
    answer:
      "Indian organisations face some of the most complex regulatory requirements in the world - mandatory CERT-In incident reporting within 6 hours, RBI cybersecurity frameworks for banks and NBFCs, DPDP Act data protection obligations, SEBI's CSCRF for capital market entities, and IRDAI guidelines for insurers. Simultaneously, Indian IT exporters face ISO 27001 and SOC 2 demands from global enterprise clients. A vCISO brings deep expertise in all these frameworks simultaneously, at a fraction of the cost of a full-time hire in India's competitive CISO hiring market.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between vCISO and GRC services?",
    answer:
      "A vCISO is a strategic security leadership role - an experienced executive who owns your organisation's entire information security function, including governance, risk, compliance, incident response, board advisory, cloud security, vendor risk, and security culture. GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) is a framework or function - typically focused on policy documentation, risk registers, and compliance gap analysis. GRC is a subset of what a vCISO manages. ISECURION's vCISO service includes and leads GRC, plus cloud security, AppSec, TPRM, awareness training, and executive reporting - under one unified engagement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Indian cities does ISECURION serve for vCISO services?",
    answer:
      "ISECURION provides vCISO services across all major Indian cities including Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Noida, Gurgaon, and beyond. Our engagements are available through flexible remote, hybrid, and on-site models. ISECURION has offices in Bengaluru (HQ), Kolkata, Ahmedabad, and Noida for on-site engagements across India.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a vCISO help with RBI compliance for banks and NBFCs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. ISECURION's vCISOs have direct experience with RBI's Master Direction on IT governance, cybersecurity frameworks, IS audit requirements, incident reporting obligations, and board-level cyber risk reporting. We help banks, NBFCs, payment aggregators, fintech companies, and co-operative banks design and maintain RBI-compliant security programmes, prepare for RBI IS audits, and meet cybersecurity resilience benchmarks set by the regulator.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a vCISO help with DPDP Act 2023 compliance?",
    answer:
      "Yes. India's Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023 creates significant new obligations for organisations that process personal data of Indian residents. ISECURION's vCISO helps classify personal data, implement consent management frameworks, establish breach notification procedures, support DPO appointment, and build technical controls aligned with DPDP obligations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What industries benefit most from vCISO services in India?",
    answer:
      "In India, the highest-impact sectors include BFSI (banks, NBFCs, fintech, insurance, capital markets), IT/ITES and SaaS companies exporting to global markets, healthcare and health-tech, e-commerce and digital platforms, government-adjacent IT companies, manufacturing and automotive technology firms, and early-stage startups seeking ISO 27001 or SOC 2 certification to win enterprise customers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can ISECURION deploy a vCISO?",
    answer:
      "We can onboard a Virtual CISO within 1-2 weeks following an initial briefing and engagement agreement. For organisations facing urgent regulatory deadlines (CERT-In audit, RBI IS audit, SOC 2 readiness window), we prioritise rapid onboarding to ensure momentum is not lost.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is vCISO suitable for startups and early-stage companies?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. vCISO is ideal for startups and SMEs that need enterprise-grade security leadership but cannot justify a full-time CISO hire. We offer foundational vCISO packages specifically designed for early-stage organisations - helping them achieve ISO 27001 certification, SOC 2 readiness, or DPDP compliance to win enterprise customers and meet investor requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the vCISO participate in board and management meetings?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our vCISO attends and presents at board meetings, executive committees, IT steering committees, and audit committee meetings - briefing leadership on security posture, strategic risks, compliance status, and investment recommendations. This is particularly important for organisations regulated by RBI, SEBI, and IRDAI where board-level accountability for cybersecurity is explicitly required by the regulator.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can vCISO services handle multiple compliance frameworks simultaneously?",
    answer:
      "Yes. ISECURION's vCISO is specifically designed for multi-framework compliance. Many Indian organisations need to simultaneously address RBI requirements, CERT-In obligations, ISO 27001 certification for clients, and SOC 2 reports for US customers. We use unified control mapping to avoid duplication of effort - ensuring evidence collected for one framework satisfies requirements across multiple standards efficiently.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can we get started with ISECURION's vCISO services?",
    answer:
      "Reach out via our Contact Page, fill the consultation form at the top of this page, call us at +91-88612 01570, or email info@isecurion.com. We will schedule an initial consultation to understand your organisation's size, regulatory obligations, security maturity, and engagement needs - and provide a tailored proposal within 48 hours.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What should we look for when evaluating CISO advisory companies?",
    answer:
      "When shortlisting CISO advisory companies, look for demonstrated regulatory depth (RBI, CERT-In, DPDP, SEBI, ISO 27001, SOC 2), a team-based delivery model rather than a single consultant, references from your industry, clear board-reporting capability, and the ability to move from advisory recommendations to hands-on implementation. ISECURION combines all of these - a CERT-In empanelled, ISO 27001:2022 certified practice with a bench of certified vCISOs across BFSI, IT/ITES, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors.",
